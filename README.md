# About

devroast.com is a message board where one can ask for feedback on their own website, i.e. for their website to be “roasted” ... We hope that this will be a fun experience, and participants will be “roasted gently.”

This website will be built by a group of programmers under the direction and coaching of Denise Mauldin and other mentors from the PuPPy community (Puget Sound Programming Python.)

The landing page should look like a message board where anyone can see the most recent posts of those asking for feedback on their websites as well as the responses from other users.

To submit a request for feedback or comment on a post, a user will first create an account via a form that will ask for a user name, password, and email. The username and email will be verified as original. The email will be verified as belonging to the user.

To ask for feedback a verified user can click on an icon, which initializes a form, then fill out the form with the website address and any specific questions. Each question can include a tag that the respondents can click on to respond to.

There will be two basic ways to comment. First, from within the original post, a verified user can click on the tag associated with a specific question. This will initialize a comment form with a reference to the tag and an open field for whatever the commentator wants to say. A second way to comment is to click an icon that will initialize a a blank field to write a comment. In either case the commentator can manually add an @ tag to reference a question. Multiple questions can be referenced within one comment.

Any comment can be commented on using the same logic.

Any verified user will be able to vote a comment up or down.

Any user will be the able to sort comments by 1. most popular, 2. all in sequential order or 3. by @ tag in sequential order.

# Setup

Fork and clone the repository

```
cd devroastproject
```

Rename `env.example` to `.env`, and change the values that need to be changed.

create the devroast volume that will be used to store the postgres data:

```
docker volume create devroast
```

create the docker images with

```
docker-compose build
```

start the docker containers with:

```
docker-compose up
```

# Configuration

If the postgres configuration is changed then the devroast volume will
need to be destroyed (which will also destroy all data in the database)
and then re-created:

```
docker volume rm devroastproject_devroast
docker volume create devroast
```

This is often the case if there are messages in the postgres logs about
password authentication failed or Role "postgres" does not exist.

postgres_1 | [27] FATAL: password authentication failed for user "postgres"

postgres_1 | [27] DETAIL: Role "postgres" does not exist.

# Docker Notes

To run in a detached mode:

```
docker-compose up -d
```

To see what is running:

```
docker-compose ps
```

To see the logs for the containers

```
docker-compose logs
```

To see just the specific container, use the name from the docker-compose.yml file

```
docker-compose logs <CONTAINER_NAME>
```

To stop the containers:

```
docker-compose stop
```

To run individual front-end test specs with the Cypress UI:

```
cd .\frontend\react-frontend\
./node_modules/.bin/cypress open --config-file ./cypress-UI-config.json
```

The `cypress open` command will install node modules from wherever it was run, so be sure to navigate to `/react-frontend` before running it.
The UI config file is used to override the URLs used in the Docker containers.
Occasionally the API stubbing will fail, but the calls are made to be rejected.

To run all front-end tests from the container (this can be flaky):

```
docker-compose up --exit-code-from cypress
```

A secondary staticfiles link was added to work within the compose. All API calls automatically fail from inside.
